Your feedback is invaluable in helping make Windows 7 a high quality operating system. With your help, we have reached the next major milestone on the journey to Windows 7: the Release Candidate (RC). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>On April 30th, the RC became available to <a href="http://co1piltwb.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/mcoeredir/mcoeredirect.aspx?linkId=11840123&amp;s1=a8d32e9f-0d3d-1f61-f7c2-91589dc6a8d0">MSDN subscribers</a> and <a href="http://co1piltwb.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/mcoeredir/mcoeredirect.aspx?linkId=11840124&amp;s1=a8d32e9f-0d3d-1f61-f7c2-91589dc6a8d0">TechNet Plus subscribers</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>On Tuesday, May 5 (PST), the RC will be available to everyone via our Customer Preview Program. As with the Beta, the Windows 7 RC Customer Preview Program is a broad public program that offers the RC free to anyone who wants to download it. It will be <b>available at least through June 30, 2009</b>, with no limits on the number of downloads or product keys available.</p>  <p><b><i>So you don’t need rush to make sure you get your copy. When you’re ready to download the RC, it’ll be waiting for you. </i></b>    <br />To get the RC please use one of the following links:</p>  <p><a href="http://co1piltwb.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/mcoeredir/mcoeredirect.aspx?linkId=11840125&amp;s1=a8d32e9f-0d3d-1f61-f7c2-91589dc6a8d0">Developers </a></p>  <p><a href="http://co1piltwb.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/mcoeredir/mcoeredirect.aspx?linkId=11840126&amp;s1=a8d32e9f-0d3d-1f61-f7c2-91589dc6a8d0">IT Pros/Microsoft Partners </a></p>  <p><a href="http://co1piltwb.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/mcoeredir/mcoeredirect.aspx?linkId=11840127&amp;s1=a8d32e9f-0d3d-1f61-f7c2-91589dc6a8d0">Tech Enthusiasts/Consumers </a></p>  <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: If you are running Windows 7 Beta you’ll need to back up your data (preferably on an external device) and then do a clean install of the Windows 7 Release Candidate. After installing Windows 7, you will need to reinstall applications and restore your files. If you need help with the installation process, please see the <a href="http://co1piltwb.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/mcoeredir/mcoeredirect.aspx?linkId=11840128&amp;s1=a8d32e9f-0d3d-1f61-f7c2-91589dc6a8d0">Installation Instructions.</a>     <br />If you’re running Windows Vista, you can install Window 7 RC without having to back up and reinstall your programs and data. But to be on the safe side, please do backup your data before you start.     <br /><b>Please note</b>: All users of the Windows 7 Release Candidate (including Windows Vista users who have upgraded to the Release Candidate) must do a clean installation of Windows 7 RTM. Please keep this is mind as you consider downloading the Release Candidate as opposed to waiting for the general availability release.     <br />Thanks again for your help in reaching this important milestone. We hope that you will join us in testing the RC and finishing Windows 7! </p>  <hr />  <p>You are receiving this important message about Windows 7 because you downloaded the Beta or RC from either TechNet, MSDN or the Windows web site.    <br />Microsoft respects your privacy.
